### About me

In 2020, by chance I read an article on the website habr.com about the top programming languages, in which Python was in the first place. By the end of the year, I had already completed the Python 3 course on Stepik with distinction. After the course, I learned on my own layout through youtube. And I realized that front-end development is what I want to do. So I decided to take additional IT course in one of the educational centers where I studied React and JS. In the meantime I was taking web-development lessons on Udemy.
